# Support Vector Machine Project: Iris Flower Species Classification


The Iris flower dataset, also known as Fisher's Iris dataset, is a classic multivariate dataset introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in 1936. The dataset contains 150 samples, each representing a species of Iris flower: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. Four features are measured from each sample: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The goal of this project is to build a Support Vector Machine model that can accurately classify the species of Iris flowers based on the provided features.
